# ‚òï Client Contract API

A RESTful API built with **Spring Boot (Java 21)** and **PostgreSQL**, designed to manage **clients** (persons or companies) and their associated **contracts**.

This project was developed as part of the **technical assessment** for the **Java / Spring Boot Developer** position at **Vaudoise Assurances ‚Äì API Factory**.

## üß† Architecture & Design

This API follows a layered architecture (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository) built with Spring Boot 3.5, Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL.
Entities are managed via Hibernate ORM and mapped to DTOs using MapStruct.
Validation is enforced through Jakarta Bean Validation annotations (@Email, @Pattern, @Positive, etc.), and error handling is centralized in a GlobalExceptionHandler, providing consistent JSON responses.
Soft deletion is implemented at the service layer, allowing entities to be logically deleted while preserving their historical data.
Liquibase is integrated for future production deployment and database migration management, ensuring reproducible and version-controlled schema evolution.
Endpoints strictly follow REST conventions (201 Created, 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict, etc.) and are documented via OpenAPI 3 / Swagger UI for easy exploration and testing.

## ‚úÖ Proof

All core use cases are covered by **JUnit 5** and **MockMvc** tests in `src/test/java`.  
To verify locally:
```bash
./mvnw test
```
