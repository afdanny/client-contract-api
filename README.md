# ‚òï Client Contract API

A RESTful API built with **Spring Boot (Java 21)** and **PostgreSQL**, designed to manage **clients** (persons or companies) and their associated **contracts**.

This project was developed as part of the **technical assessment** for the **Java / Spring Boot Developer** position at **Vaudoise Assurances ‚Äì API Factory**.

## üß† Architecture & Design

This API follows a **layered architecture (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository)** using **Spring Boot 3.5**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
Entities are persisted through **JPA/Hibernate** and exposed as DTOs via **MapStruct**, ensuring a clean separation between data and presentation layers.  
Validation is handled using **Jakarta Validation** annotations (`@Email`, `@Pattern`, `@Positive`, etc.).  
Soft-deletion is implemented at the service layer: when a client is deleted, its active contracts are automatically closed by setting their end date to the current date.  
Error handling is centralized with a `GlobalExceptionHandler`, providing consistent JSON responses.  
Endpoints use clear REST semantics (`201 Created`, `404 Not Found`, `409 Conflict`) and demonstrate scalability via pagination, filtering, and aggregation patterns.

## ‚úÖ Proof

All core use cases are covered by **JUnit 5** and **MockMvc** tests in `src/test/java`.  
To verify locally:
```bash
./mvnw test
```
